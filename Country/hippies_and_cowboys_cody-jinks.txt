Well I started on the whiskey pretty early this morning
That's alright, I was up all night
But I passed out before the sun came up
I really wanted to see one of those
I know that's no way for a man to behave
With a mortgage due and a baby on the way
But somehow I made it to where I'm at
It's been a living as a matter of fact
I get a bad attitude from being tired and running 'round
I never ask for anyone to say they like my sound
I've never been a part of any musical scene
I ain't just talking Nashville, if you know what I mean
They don't write about me in their magazines
And I don't ask for no reviews on the songs that I sing
I never had a lot of friends and I'm alright by that
But people keep on coming back
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don't care about no trends
They don't care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
I've been standing on the outside for all of my life
But I like the view, I'm not gonna lie
Yeah, the yuppies and the hipsters and the wannabe scenes
That ain't down-home to me
I like two dollar beers, I like three dollar wells
At some old honkytonk bar that I know by the smell
Some old drunk on a barstool on a Merle Haggard tune
That's my kind of room
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don't care about no trends
They don't care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don't care about no trends
They don't care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
And I'll be raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
