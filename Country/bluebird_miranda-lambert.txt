Yeah, I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at, 34 was bad
So I just turn to 35

Yeah, I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm gonna play 'em for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well

Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn twenty cents into a ten
And if I get confused, and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn the light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh, ooh

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep the light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Ooh
And the bluebird sings
Ooh
