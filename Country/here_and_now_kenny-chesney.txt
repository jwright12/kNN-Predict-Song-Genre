Seen the skyline of New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll

I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea

You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living, 'cause all we've got is here and now
